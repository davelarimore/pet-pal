## <a name="about"></a>About:
Pet Pals helps pet care providers and their clients share information about their pets and services. Users can sign up as either a client (pet owner) or a provider (dog walker, pet sitter). The app is especially helpful for providers, since they can access client and pet information at all times via their mobile device.
